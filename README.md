Clocking System with Facial Recognition
Overview
The Clocking System with Facial Recognition is a Python-based application designed to automate attendance tracking. It leverages facial recognition to identify users and log their clock-in times accurately. This innovative system eliminates the need for traditional methods like ID cards or manual entry, offering a secure and efficient solution for attendance management.

Features
Facial Recognition: Detects and identifies users using facial images.
Automated Logging: Records clock-in times in real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive application flow.
Data Storage: Securely stores attendance data for reporting and analysis.
Scalability: Designed to accommodate multiple users.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
Required Python Libraries:
opencv-python
numpy
dlib
sqlite3 (or any preferred database library)
face_recognition
A webcam or external camera for capturing facial images.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Yandisa619/ClockingSystem.git
cd ClockingSystem
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:
Ensure the database file (user_data.db) is located in the application directory.
Run the provided database initialization script if needed.
Usage
Add Users:

Add user facial images to the designated folder (images/).
Use the setup script to register users in the database.
Start the Application:

bash
Copy code
python clocking_system.py
Clock-In Process:

The application will activate the camera.
Stand in front of the camera; the system will detect and recognize your face.
Upon successful recognition, your clock-in time is logged automatically.
View Logs:

Access attendance records through the database or export logs to a file.
Screenshots
Add screenshots here to showcase the application interface.

Future Enhancements
Integration with cloud storage for remote data access.
Advanced analytics and reporting.
Enhanced security features.
